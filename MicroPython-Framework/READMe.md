# MicroPython Installation Guide for Raspberry Pi Pico

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing MicroPython firmware on your Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico board
- Micro-USB cable
- Computer with a USB port
- Internet connection

## Installation Steps

1. **Download MicroPython Firmware**:
   - Either visit the [official MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/) to download the MicroPython firmware suitable for Raspberry Pi Pico or use the pre-downloaded one in this directory.
   - Choose the appropriate firmware version and click on the download link.

2. **Enter Bootloader Mode on Raspberry Pi Pico**:
   - To enter bootloader mode, press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - While holding the `BOOTSEL` button, connect the Pico to your computer using a micro-USB cable.
   - Release the `BOOTSEL` button after connecting. The Pico will appear as a removable drive on your computer.

3. **Copy Firmware to Raspberry Pi Pico**:
   - Locate the downloaded MicroPython firmware file on your computer.
   - Copy the firmware file (usually with a `.uf2` extension) to the removable drive representing your Raspberry Pi Pico. This will automatically flash the firmware onto the Pico.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - After copying the firmware file, the Raspberry Pi Pico will reboot automatically.
   - Once the reboot is complete, the Pico will appear as a new removable drive on your computer.
   - You can now start using MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Getting Started with MicroPython

1. **Connect Raspberry Pi Pico to Computer**:
   - Use a micro-USB cable to connect your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer.
   - The Pico should appear as a USB drive on your computer.

2. **Access MicroPython REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
   - Use a serial terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, minicom) to connect to the serial port of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - On most operating systems, you can connect using the following command:
     ```
     screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
     ```
     (Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the appropriate serial port on your system.)

3. **Start Coding**:
   - You can now start writing and executing MicroPython code directly on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Use the REPL to interactively run Python commands or write Python scripts and save them to the Pico's filesystem.
