# MicroPython Code Basics

## 1. Hello World:
```python
print("Hello, MicroPython!")
```

## 2. Variables and Data Types:
```python
# Integer
x = 10
# Float
y = 3.14
# String
name = "MicroPython"
# Boolean
is_enabled = True
```

## 3. Control Structures:
```python
# If statement
temperature = 25
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
elif temperature < 10:
    print("It's cold outside!")
else:
    print("The weather is pleasant.")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Count:", i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

## 4. GPIO Control:
```python
import machine
import time

# Configure GPIO pin
led_pin = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)

# Toggle LED
while True:
    led_pin.value(not led_pin.value())
    time.sleep(1)
```

## 5. File Operations:
```python
# Write to a file
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello from MicroPython!")

# Read from a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:", content)
```

## Conclusion:
- These basic examples demonstrate how to write and execute code in MicroPython, covering variables, control structures, GPIO control, and file operations. With these fundamentals, developers can start building their own projects and experimenting with MicroPython on microcontroller platforms.
