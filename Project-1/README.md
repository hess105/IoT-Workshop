For this initial project session, we will keep it simple and introduce you to the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board by interfacing with its onboard LED and manually toggling the GPIO pins.

## Requirments
- Raspberry Pi Pico Board
- Micro-USB Cable
- Computer with Thonny IDE installed
- Python

## Getting Started
- Connect your Pico to the computer with the micro-USB cable.
- In Thonny select the correct interpreter and port to connect to your Pico.
- Copy the program files and run the program on your Pico.
- You should see the onboard LED blinking.
- Try changing the program parameters to change the frequency of the blinking.

## Troubleshooting
LED Not Blinking:
- Ensure the Pico board is connected and powered.
IDE Connection Issues:
- Ensure the correct interpreter and port in your IDE is selected.
